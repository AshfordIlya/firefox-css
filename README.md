# CSS
Messy CSS, put together over time when I wanted to change something with little regard to what existed already in the file. Nothing too redundant.

### Scale ###
My firefox is scaled up, to change yours goto about:config and edit layout.css.devPixelsPerPx to your desired setting, mine is 1.6.
