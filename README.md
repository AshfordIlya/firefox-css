# CSS
Slightly messy CSS, put together over time when I wanted to change something with little regard to what existed already in the file. Nothing too redundant.
Using FF 114. Missing some buttons but can add back yourself, or I may do so in the near future. I remove all widgets from the address bar area myself.

Which afaik is a fork of an old (FF 29) userChrome called [Melbourne by noha-ra.](https://www.deviantart.com/noha-ra/art/Melbourne-Firefox-CSS-FF-29-and-above-473887761)

#### Scale #### 
My firefox is scaled up, to change yours goto about:config and edit layout.css.devPixelsPerPx to your desired setting, mine is 1.7.
